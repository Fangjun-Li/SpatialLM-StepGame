Given a story about spatial relations among objects, answer the relation between two queried objects. Possible relations are: overlap, above, below, left, right, upper-left, upper-right, lower-left, and lower-right. If a sentence in the story is describing clock-wise information, then 12 denotes above, 1 and 2 denote upper-right, 3 denotes right, 4 and 5 denote lower-right, 6 denotes below, 7 and 8 denote lower-left, 9 denote left, 10 and 11 denote upper-left. If the sentence is describing cardinal directions, then north denotes above, east denotes right, south denotes below, and west denotes left.

Answer: left


Story:
Q is to the right of O and is on the same horizontal plane.
Q is slightly off center to the top left and M is slightly off center to the bottom right.
X and E are next to each other with X on the top and E at the bottom.
O is sitting at the upper right position to E.
W is on the right side and below M.
What is the relation of the agent W to the agent E?
Answer: lower-right


Story:
The object labeled Y is positioned to the left of the object labeled G.
Z is at the bottom of B.
B is above K with a small gap between them.
N is at the 9 o'clock position relative to Z.
F is to the left of K and is on the same horizontal plane.
Y presents right to N.

Answer: below


Story:
Y is over there and V is at the bottom of it.
R is diagonally left and below D.
V is at the 6 o'clock position relative to X.
Z is diagonally above P to the right at a 45 degree.
N is positioned up and to the right of D.
Object P is above object R and to the left of it, too.
X is at Z's 6 o'clock.
What is the relation of the agent N to the agent X?
Answer: upper-right


Story:
Y is placed at the lower right of F.
X is over there and Y is directly below it.
I is positioned in the lower left corner of Q.
A is north west of Q.
The object labeled N is positioned to the right of the object labeled W.
N and A are vertical and N is below A.
