Given a story about spatial relations among objects, answer the relation between two queried objects. Possible relations are: overlap, above, below, left, right, upper-left, upper-right, lower-left, and lower-right. If a sentence in the story is describing clock-wise information, then 12 denotes above, 1 and 2 denote upper-right, 3 denotes right, 4 and 5 denote lower-right, 6 denotes below, 7 and 8 denote lower-left, 9 denote left, 10 and 11 denote upper-left. If the sentence is describing cardinal directions, then north denotes above, east denotes right, south denotes below, and west denotes left.

Story:
P is sitting at the top position to Z.
C is at the 3 o'clock position relative to T.
R is above M.
B is above Z at 10 o'clock.
L is diagonally below A to the left at a 45 degree angle.
M is at the 12 o'clock position relative to O.
R is diagonally below P to the left at a 45 degree angle.
O is above A.
B and C are in a vertical line with C below B.
What is the relation of the agent R to the agent L?
Answer: upper-right

Story:
B is on the top side to Q.
I is at the 9 o'clock position relative to A.
I is above Q at 2 o'clock.
X is positioned down and to the left of A.
Z is on the left side of and below B.
Object O is above object K and to the left of it, too.
X is placed at the upper right of R.
Z is sitting at the upper right position to T.
O is on the right and R is on the left.
What is the relation of the agent T to the agent B?
Answer: lower-left

Story:
B is over there and T is on the left.
E is below M at 4 o'clock.
S and W are parallel, and S on the left of W.
S is at Fâ€™s 9 o'clock.
F is at the 3 o'clock position relative to Y.
G and W are side by side with G to the left and W to the right.
O is sitting in the left direction of G.
The object labeled Y is positioned to the right of the object labeled T.
B is above E and to the left of E.
What is the relation of the agent W to the agent F?
Answer: overlap

Story:
P is over there and E is on the right of it.
C is on the lower left of M.
A is to the left of B.
Z is above C.
Z is sitting at the 3:00 position to A.
L is at the bottom of B.
P and Q are parallel, and P is to the left of Q.
Q is at a 45 degree angle to L, in the upper righthand corner.
U and E are in a vertical line with U on top.
What is the relation of the agent P to the agent M?
Answer: left

Story:
G and E are in a vertical line with E below G.
A is on the lower left of X.
Y is diagonally right and above U.
I is on top of C.
V is on the left side of and below C.
U is positioned above V.
I is above A with a small gap between them.
K is at a 45 degree angle to E, in the upper righthand corner.
K is south east of X.
