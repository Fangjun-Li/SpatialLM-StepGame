Given a story about spatial relations among objects, answer the relation between two queried objects. Possible relations are: overlap, above, below, left, right, upper-left, upper-right, lower-left, and lower-right. If a sentence in the story is describing clock-wise information, then 12 denotes above, 1 and 2 denote upper-right, 3 denotes right, 4 and 5 denote lower-right, 6 denotes below, 7 and 8 denote lower-left, 9 denote left, 10 and 11 denote upper-left. If the sentence is describing cardinal directions, then north denotes above, east denotes right, south denotes below, and west denotes left.

Story:
B is at Z's 12 o'clock.
Y is on the top and W is at the bottom.
H is sitting in the left direction of Q.
Z is under H.
A is at the 3 o'clock position relative to X.
W is over there with J above.
N is to the right of M and is on the same horizontal plane.
B is placed at the lower right of Y.
If A is the center of a clock face, M is located between 2 and 3.
X is to the right of Q horizontally.
What is the relation of the agent J to the agent Y?
Answer: overlap

Story:
G and D are side by side with G on the top and D at the bottom.
J is below and to the left of F.
D is on the upper right of E.
H is above and to the right of R.
J is diagonally right and below O.
G is over there and B is at the bottom of it.
R is on the lower left of C.
C is below V.
E and V are horizontal and E is to the left of V.
F is diagonally right and below B.
What is the relation of the agent B to the agent D?
Answer: overlap

Story:
C is above R with a small gap between them.
The objects L and Q are over there. The object L is lower and slightly to the left of the object Q.
C is to the upper left of J.
J is to the right of E.
T and A are next to each other with T on the top and A at the bottom.
G is lower right of N.
G is south east of A.
L is slightly off center to the top left and Y is slightly off center to the bottom right.
R is to the top right of Q.
If Y is the center of a clock face, T is located between 7 and 8.
What is the relation of the agent G to the agent Q?
Answer: below

Story:
L is to the left of Y and is on the same horizontal plane.
T is on the right side to P.
H is to the left of K with a small gap between them.
W is placed at the lower right of J.
S is on top of J.
Object Z is above object D and to the left of it, too.
The object D is lower and slightly to the left of the object T.
If Y is the center of a clock face, H is located between 4 and 5.
S is diagonally above L to the right at a 45 degree.
P is at the lower side of W.
What is the relation of the agent Y to the agent D?
Answer: upper-left

Story:
Q is sitting at the lower left position to U.
Z is diagonally to the bottom right of S.
F is directly south east of Y.
S is placed in the right direction of C.
R is at a 45 degree angle to Z, in the upper lefthand corner.
O is at a 45 degree angle to R, in the upper righthand corner.
A is at the 12 o'clock position relative to U.
O is to the right of Q.
If F is the center of a clock face, B is located between 4 and 5.
C is diagonally right and below Y.
What is the relation of the agent U to the agent F?
Answer: upper-right
