Given a story about spatial relations among objects, answer the relation between two queried objects. Possible relations are: overlap, above, below, left, right, upper-left, upper-right, lower-left, and lower-right. If a sentence in the story is describing clock-wise information, then 12 denotes above, 1 and 2 denote upper-right, 3 denotes right, 4 and 5 denote lower-right, 6 denotes below, 7 and 8 denote lower-left, 9 denote left, 10 and 11 denote upper-left. If the sentence is describing cardinal directions, then north denotes above, east denotes right, south denotes below, and west denotes left. In all the spatial relations, assume that all agents occupy a position on a grid point of equally spaced points in the vertical and horizontal directions and that agents occupy the nearest grid point consistent with the spatial relation. The offsets of 9 spacial relations: offset(overlap) = (0,0); offset(above) = (0,1); offset(below) = (0,-1); offset(left) = (-1,0); offset(right) = (1,0); offset(upper-left) = (-1,1); offset(upper-right) = (1,1); offset(lower-left) = (-1,-1); offset(lower-right) = (1,-1).


Story:
1. Q is to the right of O and is on the same horizontal plane.
2. Q is slightly off center to the top left and M is slightly off center to the bottom right.
3. X and E are next to each other with X on the top and E at the bottom.
4. O is sitting at the upper right position to E.
5. W is on the right side and below M.
What is the relation of the agent W to the agent E?
Reasoning:
Let's suppose W is at (0,0). We can connect W and E using the relations given in the story.
Start with W. According to 5, "W is on the right side and below M." This means M is to the upper-left of W. M= W+ offset(upper-left) = (0,0)+(-1,1)=(-1,1). Therefore, M is at (-1,1).
Then search for M. According to 2, "Q is slightly off center to the top left and M is slightly off center to the bottom right." This means Q is to the upper-left of M. Q= M+ offset(upper-left) = (-1,1)+(-1,1)=(-2,2). Therefore, Q is at (-2,2).
Then search for Q. According to 1, "Q is to the right of O and is on the same horizontal plane." This means O is to the left of Q. O= Q+ offset(left) = (-2,2)+(-1,0)=(-3,2). Therefore, O is at (-3,2).
Then search for O. According to 4, "O is sitting at the upper right position to E." This means E is to the lower-left of O. E= O+ offset(lower-left) = (-3,2)+(-1,-1)=(-4,1). Therefore, E is at (-4,1).
We've reached E. So, considering W(0,0) and E(-4,1), W is to the lower-right of E.
Answer: lower-right


Story:
1. Z and E are horizontal and Z is to the left of E.
2. S is slightly off center to the top left and X is slightly off center to the bottom right.
3. Z is sitting at the lower left position to H.
4. X is on the right and O is on the left.
5. S is there and E is at the 2 position of a clock face.
What is the relation of the agent E to the agent X?
Reasoning:
Let's suppose E is at (0,0). We can connect E and X using the relations given in the story.
Start with E. According to 5, "S is there and E is at the 2 position of a clock face." Considering the clock-wise information, 2 denotes upper-right. This means S is to the lower-left of E. S= E+ offset(lower-left) = (0,0)+(-1,-1)=(-1,-1). Therefore, S is at (-1,-1).
Then search for S. According to 2, "S is slightly off center to the top left and X is slightly off center to the bottom right." This means X is to the lower-right of S. X= S+ offset(lower-right) = (-1,-1)+(1,-1)=(0,-2). Therefore, X is at (0,-2).
We've reached X. So, considering E(0,0) and X(0,-2), E is above X.
Answer: above


Story:
1. E is diagonally above R to the right at a 45 degree.
2. O is sitting in the right direction of M.
3. M is south west of R.
4. O is on the top of V and is on the same vertical plane.
5. N is below E at 4 o'clock.
What is the relation of the agent R to the agent V?
Reasoning:
Let's suppose R is at (0,0). We can connect R and V using the relations given in the story.
Start with R. According to 1, "E is diagonally above R to the right at a 45 degree." This means E is to the upper-right of R. E= R+ offset(upper-right) = (0,0)+(1,1)=(1,1). Therefore, E is at (1,1).
Then search for E. According to 5, "N is below E at 4 o'clock." Considering the clock-wise information, 4 o'clock denotes the lower-right direction. N= E+ offset(lower-right) = (1,1)+(1,-1)=(2,0). Therefore, N is at (2,0).
Then search for N. There is no further information given about N's relation to V.
Then search for R. According to 3, "M is south west of R." Considering the cardinal directions, south west denotes lower-left. This means M is to the lower-left of R. M= R+ offset(lower-left) = (0,0)+(-1,-1)=(-1,-1). Therefore, M is at (-1,-1).
Then search for M. According to 2, "O is sitting in the right direction of M." This means O is to the right of M. O= M+ offset(right) = (-1,-1)+(1,0)=(0,-1). Therefore, O is at (0,-1).
Then search for O. According to 4, "O is on the top of V and is on the same vertical plane." This means V is below O. V= O+ offset(below) = (0,-1)+(0,-1)=(0,-2). Therefore, V is at (0,-2).
We've reached V. So, considering R(0,0) and V(0,-2), R is above V.
Answer: above


Story:
1. G is above and to the left of N.
2. C is at the 12 o'clock position relative to N.
3. If C is the center of a clock face, Z is located between 2 and 3.
4. Y is to the right of U horizontally.
5. G is above and to the right of Y.
What is the relation of the agent Z to the agent G?
Reasoning:
Let's suppose Z is at (0,0). We can connect Z and G using the relations given in the story.
Start with Z. According to 3, "If C is the center of a clock face, Z is located between 2 and 3." This means C is to the lower-left of Z. C= Z+ offset(lower-left) = (0,0)+(-1,-1)=(-1,-1). Therefore, C is at (-1,-1).
Then search for C. According to 2, "C is at the 12 o'clock position relative to N." Considering the clock-wise information, 12 denotes above. This means N is below C. N= C+ offset(below) = (-1,-1)+(0,-1)=(-1,-2). Therefore, N is at (-1,-2).
Then search for N. According to 1, "G is above and to the left of N." This means G is to the upper-left of N. G= N+ offset(upper-left) = (-1,-2)+(-1,1)=(-2,-1). Therefore, G is at (-2,-1).
We've reached G. So, considering Z(0,0) and G(-2,-1), Z is to the upper-right of G.
Answer: upper-right


Story:
1. Y and L are vertical and Y is below L.
2. The object S is lower and slightly to the left of the object K.
3. A is to the bottom left of J.
4. J is there and S is at the 2 position of a clock face.
5. Y is to the right of A and is on the same horizontal plane.
What is the relation of the agent Y to the agent S?
Reasoning:
Let's suppose Y is at (0,0). We can connect Y and S using the relations given in the story.
Start with Y. According to 5, "Y is to the right of A and is on the same horizontal plane." This means A is to the left of Y. A= Y+ offset(left) = (0,0)+(-1,0)=(-1,0). Therefore, A is at (-1,0).
Then search for A. According to 3, "A is to the bottom left of J." This means J is to the upper-right of A. J= A+ offset(upper-right) = (-1,0)+(1,1)=(0,1). Therefore, J is at (0,1).
Then search for J. According to 4, "J is there and S is at the 2 position of a clock face." Considering the clock-wise information, 2 position denotes the upper-right direction. S= J+ offset(upper-right) = (0,1)+(1,1)=(1,2). Therefore, S is at (1,2).
We've reached S. So, considering Y(0,0) and S(1,2), Y is to the lower-left of S.
