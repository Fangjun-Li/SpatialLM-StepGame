Given a story about spatial relations among objects, answer the relation between two queried objects. Possible relations are: overlap, above, below, left, right, upper-left, upper-right, lower-left, and lower-right. If a sentence in the story is describing clock-wise information, then 12 denotes above, 1 and 2 denote upper-right, 3 denotes right, 4 and 5 denote lower-right, 6 denotes below, 7 and 8 denote lower-left, 9 denote left, 10 and 11 denote upper-left. If the sentence is describing cardinal directions, then north denotes above, east denotes right, south denotes below, and west denotes left.

Story:
Y is over there and V is at the bottom of it.
R is diagonally left and below D.
V is at the 6 o'clock position relative to X.
Z is diagonally above P to the right at a 45 degree.
N is positioned up and to the right of D.
Object P is above object R and to the left of it, too.
X is at Z's 6 o'clock.
What is the relation of the agent N to the agent X?
Answer: upper-right

Story:
Z is on the right side and top of N.
F is to the left of Y and is on the same horizontal plane.
Z is to the left of K horizontally.
F is positioned below and to the right of K.
G is at W's 6 o'clock.
The object G is positioned below and to the right of the object N.
Y is upper right to R.
What is the relation of the agent G to the agent W?
Answer: below

Story:
W is positioned in the top left corner of T.
K is placed at the upper right of X.
A is placed at the lower left of E.
A is sitting at the 6:00 position to W.
T presents lower left to Q.
E is at a 45 degree angle to X, in the upper lefthand corner.
R and K are vertical and R is above K.
What is the relation of the agent R to the agent E?
Answer: upper-right

Story:
U is positioned above and to the left of F.
K is sitting in the right direction of J.
M is above J with a small gap between them.
Q is sitting at the 3:00 position to F.
M is to the top of N vertically.
U is sitting at the 6:00 position to N.
W presents left to Q.
What is the relation of the agent M to the agent Q?
Answer: upper-left

Story:
P and Y are in a horizontal line with P on the left.
G is to the left of Y.
E is sitting at the lower left position to Q.
The object G is lower and slightly to the left of the object B.
J is on the left side to I.
Object B is below object Q and to the right of it, too.
E is on the lower left of I.
What is the relation of the agent E to the agent Q?
Answer: lower-left
