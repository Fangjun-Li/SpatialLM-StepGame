Given a story about spatial relations among objects, answer the relation between two queried objects. Possible relations are: overlap, above, below, left, right, upper-left, upper-right, lower-left, and lower-right. If a sentence in the story is describing clock-wise information, then 12 denotes above, 1 and 2 denote upper-right, 3 denotes right, 4 and 5 denote lower-right, 6 denotes below, 7 and 8 denote lower-left, 9 denote left, 10 and 11 denote upper-left. If the sentence is describing cardinal directions, then north denotes above, east denotes right, south denotes below, and west denotes left. In all the spatial relations, assume that all agents occupy a position on a grid point of equally spaced points in the vertical and horizontal directions and that agents occupy the nearest grid point consistent with the spatial relation. The offsets of 9 spacial relations: offset(overlap) = (0,0); offset(above) = (0,1); offset(below) = (0,-1); offset(left) = (-1,0); offset(right) = (1,0); offset(upper-left) = (-1,1); offset(upper-right) = (1,1); offset(lower-left) = (-1,-1); offset(lower-right) = (1,-1).


Story:
1. H is above S with a small gap between them.
2. S is positioned below I.
3. P is on the top side to I.
What is the relation of the agent S to the agent P?
Linking chain: S -> I (use 2) -> P (use 3)
Reasoning:
Let's suppose S is at (0,0). We can analyze the relation of S to P by following the linking chain and considering the relations provided in the story step by step.
We can reason the relations between S and P use the linking chain and the relations given in the story step by step.
Start with S. According to 2, "S is positioned below I." This means I is above S. I= S+ offset(above) = (0,0)+(0,1)=(0,1). Therefore, I is at (0,1)
Then come to I. According to 3, "P is on the top side to I." This means P is above I. P= I+ offset(above) = (0,1)+(0,1)=(0,2). Therefore,P is at (0,2)
We've reached P. So, considering S(0,0) and P (0,2), S is below S.
Answer: below


Story:
1. Q is to the right of O and is on the same horizontal plane.
2. Q is slightly off center to the top left and M is slightly off center to the bottom right.
3. X and E are next to each other with X on the top and E at the bottom.
4. O is sitting at the upper right position to E.
5. W is on the right side and below M.
What is the relation of the agent W to the agent E?
Linking chain: W -> M (use 5) -> Q (use 2) -> O (use 1) -> E (use 4)
Reasoning:
Let's suppose W is at (0,0). We can analyze the relation of W to E by following the linking chain and considering the relations provided in the story step by step.
Start with W. According to 5, "W is on the right side and below M." This means M is to the upper-left of W. M= W+ offset(upper-left) = (0,0)+(-1,1)=(-1,1). Therefore, M is at (-1,1).
Then come to M. According to 2, "Q is slightly off center to the top left and M is slightly off center to the bottom right." This means Q is to the upper-left of M. Q= M+ offset(upper-left) = (-1,1)+(-1,1)=(-2,2). Therefore, Q is at (-2,2).
Then come to Q. According to 1, "Q is to the right of O and is on the same horizontal plane." This means O is to the left of Q. O= Q+ offset(left) = (-2,2)+(-1,0)=(-3,2). Therefore, O is at (-3,2).
Then come to O. According to 4, "O is sitting at the upper right position to E." This means E is to the lower-left of O. E= O+ offset(lower-left) = (-3,2)+(-1,-1)=(-4,1). Therefore, E is at (-4,1).
We've reached E. So, considering W(0,0) and E(-4,1), W is to the lower-right of E.
Answer: lower-right


Story:
1. Y is placed at the lower right of F.
2. X is over there and Y is directly below it.
3. I is positioned in the lower left corner of Q.
4. A is north west of Q.
5. The object labeled N is positioned to the right of the object labeled W.
6. N and A are vertical and N is below A.
7. F presents right to O.
8. O is slightly off center to the top left and W is slightly off center to the bottom right.
What is the relation of the agent Q to the agent X?
Linking chain: Q -> A (use 4) -> N (use 6) -> W (use 5) -> O (use 8) -> F (use 7) -> Y (use 1) -> X (use 2)
Reasoning:
Let's suppose Q is at (0,0). We can analyze the relation of Q to X by following the linking chain and considering the relations provided in the story step by step.
Start with Q. According to 4, "A is north west of Q." Considering the cardinal directions, north west denotes upper-left. This means A is to the upper-left of Q. A= Q+ offset(upper-left) = (0,0)+(-1,1)=(-1,1). Therefore, A is at (-1,1).
Then come to A. According to 6, "N and A are vertical and N is below A." This means N is below A. N= A+ offset(below) = (-1,1)+(0,-1)=(-1,0). Therefore, N is at (-1,0).
Then come to N. According to 5, "The object labeled N is positioned to the right of the object labeled W." This means W is to the left of N. W= N+ offset(left) = (-1,0)+(-1,0)=(-2,0). Therefore, W is at (-2,0).
Then come to W. According to 8, "O is slightly off center to the top left and W is slightly off center to the bottom right." This means O is to the upper-left of W. O= W+ offset(upper-left) = (-2,0)+(-1,1)=(-3,1). Therefore, O is at (-3,1).
Then come to O. According to 7, "F presents right to O." This means F is to the right of O. F= O+ offset(right) = (-3,1)+(1,0)=(-2,1). Therefore, F is at (-2,1).
Then come to F. According to 1, "Y is placed at the lower right of F." This means Y is to the lower-right of F. Y= F+ offset(lower-right) = (-2,1)+(1,-1)=(-1,0). Therefore, Y is at (-1,0).
Then come to Y. According to 2, "X is over there and Y is directly below it." This means X is above Y. X= Y+ offset(above) = (-1,0)+(0,1)=(-1,1). Therefore, X is at (-1,1).
We've reached X. So, considering Q(0,0) and X(-1,1), Q is to the lower-right of X.
Answer: lower-right


Story:
1. B is at Z's 12 o'clock.
2. Y is on the top and W is at the bottom.
3. H is sitting in the left direction of Q.
4. Z is under H.
5. A is at the 3 o'clock position relative to X.
6. W is over there with J above.
7. N is to the right of M and is on the same horizontal plane.
8. B is placed at the lower right of Y.
9. If A is the center of a clock face, M is located between 2 and 3.
10. X is to the right of Q horizontally.
What is the relation of the agent J to the agent Y?
Linking chain: J -> W (use 6) -> Y (use 2)
Reasoning:
Let's suppose J is at (0,0). We can analyze the relation of J to Y by following the linking chain and considering the relations provided in the story step by step.
Start with J. According to 6, "W is over there with J above." This means W is below J. W= J+ offset(below) = (0,0)+(0,-1)=(0,-1). Therefore, W is at (0,-1).
Then come to W. According to 2, "Y is on the top and W is at the bottom." This means Y is above W. Y= W+ offset(above) = (0,-1)+(0,1)=(0,0). Therefore, Y is at (0,0).
We've reached Y. So, considering J(0,0) and Y(0,0), J and Y overlap.
Answer: overlap
